x*y;

In C++ this could be a multiplication, pointer declaration, or
arbitrary overloaded meaning of "*". You have to hit name and type
resolution before you can distinguish them.

(* Cocci: Each token will be decorated in the future by the mcodekind
 * of cocci. It is the job of the pretty printer to look at this
 * information and decide to print or not the token (and also the
 * pending '+' associated sometimes with the token).
 * 
 * The first time that we parse the original C file, the mcodekind is
 * empty, or more precisely all is tagged as a CONTEXT with NOTHING
 * associated. This is what I call a "clean" expr/statement/....
 * 
 * Each token will also be decorated in the future with an environment,
 * because the pending '+' may contain metavariables that refer to some
 * C code.

 * Update: Now I use a ref! so take care.

 * Sometimes we want to add someting at the beginning or at the end 
 * of a construct. For 'function' and 'decl' we want add something
 * to their left and for 'if' 'while' et 'for' and so on at their right.
 * We want some kinds of "virtual placeholders" that represent the start or
 * end of a construct. We use fakeInfo for that purpose.
 * To identify those cases I have added a fakestart/fakeend comment.
 * 
 * convention: I often use 'ii' for the name of a list of info.
