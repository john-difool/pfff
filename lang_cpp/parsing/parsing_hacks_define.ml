(* 
 * To parse macro definitions I need to do some tricks 
 * as some information can be computed only at the lexing level. For instance
 * the space after the name of the macro in '#define foo (x)' is meaningful
 * but the grammar does not have this information. So define_ident() below
 * look at such space and generate a special TOpar_Define token. 
 * 
 * In a similar way macro definitions can contain some antislash and newlines
 * and the grammar need to know where the macro ends which is
 * a line-level and so low token-level information. Hence the 
 * function define_line'()below and the TCommentNewline_DefineEndOfMacro.
 * 
 * update: TCommentNewline_DefineEndOfMacro is handled in a special way
 * at different places, a little bit like EOF, especially for error recovery,
 * so this is an important token that should not be retagged!
 * 
 * We also change the kind of TIdent to TIdent_Define to avoid bad interactions
 * with other parsing_hack tricks. For instant if keep TIdent then
 * the stringication heuristics can believe the TIdent is a string-macro.
 * So simpler to change the kind of the TIdent in a macro too.
 *
 * ugly hack, a better solution perhaps would be to erase
 * TCommentNewline_DefineEndOfMacro from the Ast and list of tokens in parse_c.
 * 
 * note: I do a +1 somewhere, it's for the unparsing to correctly sync.
 * 
 * note: can't replace mark_end_define by simply a fakeInfo(). The reason
 * is where is the \n TCommentSpace. Normally there is always a last token
 * to synchronize on, either EOF or the token of the next toplevel.
 * In the case of the #define we got in list of token 
 * [TCommentSpace "\n"; TDefEOL] but if TDefEOL is a fakeinfo then we will
 * not synchronize on it and so we will not print the "\n".
 * A solution would be to put the TDefEOL before the "\n".
 * 
 * todo?: could put a ExpandedTok for that ?
