 * See https://github.com/facebook/pfff/wiki/Spatch
 * 
 * Here is an example of a spatch file:
 * 
 *    foo(2, 
 * -      bar(2)
 * +      foobar(4)
 *       )
 * 
 * This will replace all calls to bar(2) by foobar(4) when
 * the function call is the second argument of a call to
 * foo where its first argument is 2.
 * 
 * 
 * note: can we produce syntactically incorrect code? Yes ...
 * 
 * less: mostly copy paste of spatch_php.ml

 * Algorithm to parse a spatch file:
 *  - take lines of the file, index the lines
 *  - replace the + lines by an empty line and remember in a line_env
 *    the line and its index
 *  - remove the - in the first column and remember in a line_env
 *    that is was a minus line
 *  - unlines the filtered lines into a new string 
 *  - call the parser on this new string
 *  - go through all tokens and adjust its transfo field using the
 *    information in line_env
