   * version0: 
   *   type ('a, 'b) matcher = 'a -> 'b -> bool
   * 
   *   This just lets you know if you matched something.
   * 
   * version1:
   *   type ('a, 'b) matcher = 'a -> 'b -> unit -> ('a, 'b) option
   * 
   *   The Maybe monad.
   * 
   * version2:
   *   type ('a, 'b) matcher = 'a -> 'b -> binding -> binding list
   * 
   *   Why not returning a binding option ? because I may need at some
   *   point to return multiple possible bindings for one matching code.
   *   For instance with the pattern do 'f(..., X, ...)', X could be binded
   *   to different parts of the code.
   * 
   *   Note that the empty list means a match failure.
