Installation Procedure for Javalib

  For the impatient, familiar, or audacious

    1. tar xf javalib-2.2.1.tar.bz2
    2. cd javalib-2.2.1
    3. ./configure.sh
    4. if there are missing dependencies,
          + if ptrees was not found,
            make ptrees && make installptrees
          + if camlzip was not found,
            make camlzip && make installcamlzip
          + if extlib was not found,
            make extlib && make installextlib
          + once all dependencies have been installed,
            ./configure.sh
    5. make && make install

   You may need superuser rights for the installation phases.

  Detailed instructions

    1. Javalib makes extensive use of the [1]Findlib package manager
       (>=1.2.3) and its Ocamlfind front-end, which provide seamless
       management of OCaml libraries. Make sure you have an Objective Caml
       compiler (>=3.10.0) installed, as well as the findlib/ocamlfind
       tools.
    2. Javalib depends on three unrelated libraries: ExtLib (>=1.5.1),
       CamlZip (>=1.04), and PTrees. Some or all of these libraries might
       be provided as precompiled packages or ports in your operating
       system. E.g., for CamlZip, one can use:
          + the 'libextlib-ocaml-dev' package in Debian, Ubuntu & Co.,
          + the 'ocaml-extlib' package in Fedora or in Mac/Darwin Ports.
       If your operating system provides none (or only part of) these
       libraries, fret not: all three are included in the Javalib
       distribution, and the installation procedure will guide you through
       compiling and installing them.
       Note: If you are using OCaml 4.0 or higher, you need at least
       ExtLib 1.5.3 while only the version 1.5.1 is included in Javalib.
       So you need to install it separatly.
    3. First you need to configure the system. It is done automatically
       with the command:

                ./configure.sh [options]

       For a list of options accepted by the configuration script, run
       ./configure.sh -h. The main options are:

        -l <dir>
                Proceed to install in the local directory <dir>. Note that
                if you use Ocamlfind to compile an analysis later on, you
                will need to set the shell variable OCAMLPATH to <dir> to
                be able to use the Javalib libraries (see man findlib for
                more info on OCAMLPATH).

        -d yes|no|prof (default: yes)
                Set to yes to keep debugging information in native library
                or to prof to profile (with gprof) your program.

       Note: The configure script assumes that, if the ptrees and camlzip
       installations are local, then the Javalib installation will also be
       local. Moreover, it assumes that all of them will reside in the
       same ./lib folder.
       The configuration script generates a file called "Makefile.config".
       You are welcome to review and edit it, but keep in mind it will be
       overwritten with each execution of configure.sh.
    4. Step 3 will have stated which of the libraries CamlZip, PTrees, or
       ExtLib needed to be compiled and installed. For each of those
       required, run the following commands:

                make LIBRARYNAME
                make installLIBRARYNAME (if configure was run with the
                --local option)
                sudo make installLIBRARYNAME (else)

       Note: CamlZip is a binding to the [2]Zlib library, as a consequence
       it requires that the Zlib library was installed precedently (the
       development package is necessary if you use your OS package
       manager).
    5. Now we can check if the dependencies are correctly found---remember
       to run the script with the same options as in step 3.

                ./configure.sh [options]

    6. We can now proceed to the Javalib compilation. In the toplevel
       directory, enter:

                make
                make install (if configure was run with the --local
                option)
                sudo make install (otherwise)

    7. If you want the documentation, run:

                make doc

    8. Finally, you can clean the sources with:

                make clean

    9. If you want to verify that Javalib is correctly installed and found
       by ocaml, this command should find the library path:

                ocamlfind query javalib
