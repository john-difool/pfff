just ran ./configure to get a Makefile

version: 1.8.3 (cf src/version.ml)

Changed graph.cma to ocamlgraph.cma as it conflict with commmons/graph.ml
and so changed some open Graph into open Ocamlgraph in some .ml files

Also removed the .opt infered compilers as some users do not have
them.

See diff Makefile.orig Makefile
