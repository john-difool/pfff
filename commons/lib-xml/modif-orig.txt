Modified Makefile. 
Introduced xml_types.ml and dtd_types.ml
 otherwise got recursive dependencies between the parser and the 
 main entry point in xml.ml. 
Modified lexer to allow &foo-123.foo; as an entity name
  (needed to parse XML data from PHP Manual).
Introduce xml_utils.ml providing a few helpers.
Rename xml.ml to xml_parse.ml to avoid name conflicts
 with xML.ml on MacOS case-insensitive filesystem.
Rename hash -> Hashtbl.t for graph_code_cmt
