(* 
 * OCaml hacks to support reflection.
 * 
 * OCaml does not support reflection, and it's a good thing: we love
 * strong type-checking that forbids too clever hacks like 'eval', or
 * run-time reflection; it's too much power for you, you will misuse
 * it. At the same time it's sometimes useful. So at least we could make
 * it possible to still reflect on the type definitions or values in
 * OCaml source code. We can do it by processing ML source code and
 * emitting ML source code containing under the form of regular ML
 * value or functions meta-information about information in other
 * source code files. It's a little bit a poor's man reflection mechanism,
 * because it's more manual, but it's for the best. Metaprogramming had
 * to be painful, because it is dangerous!
 * 
 * Example: 
 *  
 *      TODO
 * 
 * In some sense we reimplement what is in the OCaml compiler, which
 * contains the full AST of OCaml source code. But the OCaml compiler
 * and its AST are too big, too scary for many tasks that would be satisfied
 * by a restricted but simpler AST.
 * 
 * Camlp4 is obviously also a solution to this problem, but it has a
 * learning curve, and it's a slightly different world than the pure
 * regular OCaml world. So this module, and ocamltarzan together can
 * reduce the problem by taking the best of camlp4, while still
 * avoiding it.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The support is partial. We support only the OCaml constructions
 * we found the most useful for programming stuff like
 * stub generators. 
 * 
 * less? not all OCaml so call it miniml.ml  ? or reflection.ml ?
 * 
 * 
 * Notes: 2 worlds 
 *   - the type level world,
 *   - the data level world
 * 
 * Then there is whether the code is generated on the fly, or output somewhere
 * to be compiled and linked again (so 2 steps process, more manual, but
 * arguably less complicated magic)
 * 
 * different level of (meta)programming:
 *
 *  - programming in OCaml on OCaml values (classic)
 *  - programming in OCaml on Sexp.t value of value
 *  - programming in OCaml on Sexp.t value of type description
 *  - programming in OCaml on OCaml.v value of value
 *  - programming in OCaml on OCaml.t value of type description
 * 
 * Depending on what you have to do, some levels are more suited than other.
 * For instance to do a show, to pretty print value, then sexp is good,
 * because really you just want to write code that handle 2 cases, 
 * atoms and list. That's really what pretty printing is all about. You
 * could write a pretty printer for Ocaml.v, but it will need to handle
 * 10 cases. Now if you want to write a code generator for python, or an ORM,
 * then Ocaml.v is better than sexp, because in sexp you lost some valuable
 * information (that you may have to reverse engineer, like whether 
 * a Sexp.List corresponds to a field, or a sum, or wether something is
 * null or an empty list, or wether it's an int or float, etc).
 * 
 * Another way to do (meta)programming is:
 *  - programming in Camlp4 on OCaml ast
 *  - writing camlmix code to generate code.
 * 
 * notes:
 *  - sexp value or sexp of type description, not as precise, but easier to 
 *    write really generic code that do not need to have more information
 *    about the sexp nodes (such as wether it's a field, a constuctor, etc)
 *  - miniml value or type, not as precise that the regular type,
 *    but more precise than sexp, and allow write some generic code.
 *  - ocaml value (not type as you cant program at type level),
 *    precise type checking, but can be tedious to write generic
 *    code like generic visitors or pickler/unpicklers
 * 
 * This file is working with ocamltarzan/pa/pa_type.ml (and so indirectly
 * it is working with camlp4).
 * 
 * Note that can even generate sexp_of_x for miniML :) really
 * reflexive tower here
 * 
 * Note that even if this module helps a programmer to avoid
 * using directly camlp4 to auto generate some code, it can 
 * not solve all the tasks. 
 *
 * history: 
 *  - Thought about it when wanting to do the ast_php.ml to be
 *    transformed into a .adsl declaration to be able to generate
 *    corresponding python classes using astgen.py.
 *  - Thought about a miniMLType and miniMLValue, and then realize
 *    that that was maybe what code in the ocaml-orm-sqlite
 *    was doing (type-of et value-of), except I wanted the 
 *    ocamltarzan style of meta-programming instead of the camlp4 one.
 * 
 * 
 * Alternatives:
 *  - camlp4
 *    obviously camlp4 has access to the full AST of OCaml, but 
 *    that is one pb, that's too much. We often want only to do 
 *    analysis on the type
 *  - type-conv
 *    good, but force to use camlp4. Can use the generic sexplib
 *    and then work on the generated sexp, but as explained below, 
 *    is will be on the value.
 *  - use lib-sexp (just the sexp library part, not the camlp4 support part)
 *    but not enough info. Even if usually
 *    can reverse engineer the sexp to rediscover the type,
 *    you will reverse engineer a value; what you want
 *    is the sexp representation of the type! not a value of this type.
 *    Also lib-sexp autogenerated code can be hard to understand, especially
 *    if the type definition is complex. A good side effect of ocaml.ml
 *    is that it provides an intermediate step :) So even if you 
 *    could pretty print value from your def to sexp directly, you could
 *    also use transform your value into a Ocaml.v, then use 
 *    the somehow more readable function that translate a v into a sexp,
 *    and same when wanting to read a value from a sexp, by using
 *    again Ocaml.v as an intermediate. It's nevertheless obviously
 *    less efficient.
 * 
 *  - zephyr, or thrift ?
 *  - F# ?
 *  - Lisp/Scheme ?
 *  - .Net interoperability

 * 
 * update: Gazagnaire made a paper about that.
 * 
 * modifications: 
 *  - slightly renamed the types and rearrange order of constructors.  Could 
 *    have use nested modules to allow to reuse Int in different contexts,  
 *    but I actually prefer to prefix the values with the V, so when debugging
 *    stuff, it's clearer that what you are looking are values, not types
 *    (even if the ocaml toplevel would prefix the value with a V. or T.,
 *    but sexp would not)
 *  - Changed Int of int option
 *  - Introduced List, Apply, Poly
