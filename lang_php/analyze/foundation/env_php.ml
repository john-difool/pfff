 * In PHP many globals are defined in a php.ini file and can be accessed in 
 * the program, e.g. PHP_ROOT. It is useful for some static analysis
 * to know the value of those globals, hence this file.
 * 
 * related: builtins_php.ml that take care of not global variables but
 * builtin functions (and extensions)
 *)
