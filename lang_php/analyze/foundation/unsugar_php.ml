(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(*
 * There are a few constructions in the PHP AST such as self:: and parent::
 * that makes certain analysis more tedious to write. The goal of this
 * module is just to unsugar those features.
 *
 * Note that if you want a really unsugared AST you should use pil.ml
 * instead.
 *
 * Note also that even if people use self::foo(), the foo() method may
 * actually not be in self but possibly in its parents; so we need
 * too lookup ancestors anyway ...
 *
 * todo? turns out people also use self:: or parent:: or static::
 * in strings, to pass callbacks, so may have to unsugar the strings
 * too?
 *
 * todo: have a unsugar_traits() that do the inlining of the mixins.
 * This requires an entity_finder.
 * 
 * todo: handle namespace? resolve to final names? maybe time
 * to deprecate this file, graph_code_php.ml is better. This file
 * just handle self/parent and not even in a complete way.
 *)

(* I also return the original token of self/parent so the caller can decide
 * to do a rewrap on it. This is better than subsituting
 * the name by the referenced class because ii_of_any and range_of_ii
 * could get confused by having some ASTs that contains "foreign" ii.
