(* Being able to access the definition of a class from a a program requires
 * a global analysis to find where is the class. This should mean
 * that each time some of the analyze_php/ functions need such thing they
 * would need to know about database_php.ml which leads to too many
 * dependencies. Enter 'entity_finder', which is usually build
 * via a closure from a database, but which hides the database to the
 * function using it. See database_php_build.build_entity_finder
 * or entity_finder_of_graph_code below for functions building
 * such entity_finder.
 * 
 * For methods the string below will also contain the class as
 * in "Foo::method".
