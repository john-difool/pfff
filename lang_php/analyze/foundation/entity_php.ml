(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* 
 * In different structures such as the callgraph we need to refer to a
 * certain PHP entity, like a specific function. Usually those specific
 * pieces of code we want to refer to are functions or classes. So we need
 * a way to represent such place. We can use the location, which is the
 * fullid described below but it takes quite some space (a string, 2
 * ints). Enter the 'id' type.
 * 
 * update: we now also have "nested" ids which are ids about nested
 * entities like methods (of a class) or nested functions. Could have
 * defined an id type and subid type but this seems tedious. Better to
 * have only 'id' and a 'id_kind' and associated tables that stores subasts
 * and other info (see children_id and enclosing_id tables in
 * database_php.ml)
 * 
 * todo? One pb is that we lose some precision. Sometimes we would like
 * to enforce a certain kind of id. So all this scheme is good ? At the
 * same time a function can be called from many stuff, another func, a
 * toplevel stmt, a method, an expression in a variable declaration, etc
 * so maybe simpler to have indeed a single 'id'.
 * 
 * update: this file may be a little bit obsolete now that we use prolog
 * and the abstract interpreter for most of our needs. The id
 * in prolog is then simply the function name atom or the pair of atoms
 * with the class and method names (and atoms are represented efficiently
 * I hope in the Prolog engine).
 * 
 * todo? hmmm but maybe we could have a entity_finder2: 
 *  type entity_finder2 = { functions: ...; classes: ... }
 * which would be close to what julien is using in his code when he
 * needs some global analysis.
 *

(* Types *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* primary key (prefered) method *) 
type id = Id of int

(* also primary key, more readable, but less optimial spacewise *)
type filepos = {
  file: filename;
  line: int;
  column: int;
}
 (* with tarzan *)
type fullid = filepos

(* id_kind is now just an alias. Indeed it was copy-paste/redundant with
 * Datbase_code.ml.
 * 
 * todo? there are still some duplications:
 *  - highlight_code.ml
 *  - Ast_php.entity (but without the actual ast content)
 *  - view_widgets_source.ml ?
 *  - typing_c environment type
 *  - type_annotater_c.ml namedef type
 * 
 * note: StaticMethod could be considered a Function, because in PHP they
 * mostly use static methods because PHP (5.2) didn't have namespace and
 * so they abuse classes for modules. But right now we use Method.
 * 
 * Xhp declarations are considered Fields.
 *)
type id_kind = Database_code.entity_kind

(* See comment in the .mli for more information about entity_finder.
 * 
 * update: I now return a list of entities instead of a single entity
 * and raising a Not_found or Multi_found. The rational is that
 * the caller knows better what to do when there are multiple
 * matching definitions for an entity. For instance for 
 * better error message having just Multi_found is not enough.
 * The caller needs for instance to show two witnesses.
