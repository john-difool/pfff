(*****************************************************************************)
(*
 * Main types and data structures used by the PHP abstract interpreter:
 * The "environment" and the "heap".
 * 
 * In the abstract interpreter, all variables are pointers to pointers
 * of values. So with '$x = 42;' we got $x = &2{&1{42}}.
 * In 'env.vars' we got "$x" = Vptr 2 and in the 'heap' we
 * then got [0 -> ...; 1 -> Vint 42; 2 -> Vptr 1]
 * meaning that $x is a variable with address 2, where the content
 * of this cell is a pointer to address 1, where the content of
 * this cell is the value 42. This is consistent with how Zend
 * manages values and variables at runtime (the "zval").
 * 
 * References:
 *  - on zval: http://blog.golemon.com/2007/01/youre-being-lied-to.html
 *  - todo: there was another doc about zvalues that bmathews once talked about
 *  - todo: POPL paper on PHP copy-on-write semantic?
 *
 * Why this model? Why not having variables contain directly values,
 * that is $x = {42} without any Vptr? Because dealing with lvalues in the
 * interpreter would then be tedious. For instance with '$x = array(1,2,3);'
 * How would you handle '$x[0] = 1;' without any Vptr and a heap?
 * You would need to use OCaml references to mimic those Vptr.
 * 
 * Why not just variables be pointer to values then? Because
 * of references. With this code:
 * 
 *   $x = 2;
 *   var_dump($x);
 *   $y =& $x;
 *   var_dump($x);
 * 
 * We will have at the first var_dump(): $x = &2{&1{2}}
 * and at the second var_dump: $x = &2{&REF 1{2}}, $y = &4{&REF 1{2}}
 * See the code of assign in the interpreter for more information.
 * 
 * Retrospecively, was it good to try to manage references correctly?
 * After all, many other things are not that well handled in the interpreter
 * or imprecise or passed-over silently, e.g. many functions/classes not
 * found, traits not handled, lambda not handled, choosing
 * arbitrarily one object in a Vsum when there could actually be many
 * different classes, not really doing a fixpoint on loops, etc.
 * Maybe it was not a good idea to focus so much on references. Moreover it
 * slows down things a lot. One advantage though of managing references
 * correctly is that it forces to really understand how Zend PHP internally
 * works (zvalues). Note that HPHP may do certain optimizations so those
 * pointers of pointers may actually not exist for many local variables
 * when we statically know they are never "referenced".

(* Types *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* In practice a huge codebase contains unfortunately sometimes
 * functions (or classes) with the same name, but here we will
 * just return one of those possible entities :( (at least we detect and
 * warn about dupes when building the code database, see
 * database_juju_php.ml). 
*)
type code_database = {
  funs:      string -> Ast.func_def;
  classes:   string -> Ast.class_def;
  constants: string -> Ast.constant_def;
}

(* The abstract interpreter manipulates "values" *)
type value =
  (* Precise values. Especially useful for Vstring for interprocedural
   * analysis as people use strings to represent functions or classnames
   * (they are not first-class citizens in PHP). Maybe also useful
   * for Vint when use ints for array indices and we want the precise
   * value in the array.
   *)
  | Vbool   of bool
  | Vint    of int
  | Vfloat  of float (* not that useful *)
  | Vstring of string

  (* We converge quickly to a very abstract value. Values are either
   * a single precise value (e.g. 42), or a type (e.g. int). No
   * intermediate range for instance.
   *)
  | Vabstr  of type_

  (* could be useful for nullpointer analysis *)
  | Vnull

  (* try to differentiate the different (abusive) usage of PHP arrays *)
  | Vrecord of value SMap.t
  | Varray  of value list
  | Vmap of value * value

  (* The first 'value' below is for '$this' which will be a pointer to
   * the object. The only place where it's used is in Unify.value.
   * Note that $this, as well as self/parent, are also handled
   * via closures in make_method().
   * 
   * The integer key of the IMap below is a unique identifier for a 
   * method (we could have chosen the full name as in "A::foo"). The
   * Imap is a set of methods because when we unify/merge objects,
   * we merge methods and remember all possible values for this method.
   * It's essentially a (closures Set.t) but because we can't compare
   * for equality closures in OCaml we need this method id intermediate
   * and IMap. See sum_call() in the interpreter and call_methods().
   * 
   * make_method() builds the method closure with self/parent/this
   * correctly bind to the right class and object pointers.
   * 
   * What is the value of $x given: 
   *   class A { public function foo() { } }
   *   $x = new A();
   * It should be:
   * $x = &2{REF 1{Vobject (["foo"->Vmethod (&2{rec}, [0x42-> (<foo closure>)])])}}
   *)
  | Vmethod of value * (env -> heap -> Ast.expr list -> heap * value) IMap.t
  (* We would need a Vfun too if we were handling Lambda. But for
   * regular function calls, we just handle 'Call (Id "...")' specially
   * in the interpreter (but we don't for 'Call (Obj_get ...)', hence
   * this intermediate Vmethod value above).
   *)

  (* Objects are represented as a set of members where a member can be
   * a constant, a field, a static variable, or a method. for instance with:
   * 
   *    class A {
   *      public $fld = 1;
   *      static public $fld2 = 2;
   *      public function foo() { }
   *      static public function bar() { }
   *      const CST = 3;
   *    }
   *    $o = new A();
   * 
   * we will get:
   * 
   * $o = &2{&REF 16{object(
   *   'fld' => &19{&18{1}}, 
   *   '$fld2' => &10{&9{2}})
   *   'foo' => method(&17{&REF 16{rec}), 
   *   'bar' => method(&17{&REF 16{rec}), 
   *   'CST' => 2, 
   *   }}
   * 
   * Note that static variables keep their $ in their name but not
   * regular fields. They are also shared by all objects of the class.
   * 
   * A class is actually also represented as a Vobject, with a special
   * *BUILD* method which is called when we do 'new A()', so on previous
   * example we will get in env.globals:
   * A = &6{&5{object(
   *     '$fld2' => &10{&9{2}})
   *     'foo' => method(Null), 
   *     'bar' => method(Null), 
   *     'CST' => 2, 
   *     '*BUILD*' => method(Null), 
   *  }}
   * 
   * TODO, not sure why we get foo() here there too.
   *)
  | Vobject of value SMap.t

  (* Union of possible types/values, ex: null | object, bool | string, etc.
   * This could grow a lot, so the abstract interpreter needs to turn
   * that into a Vany at some point ???
   *)
  | Vsum    of value list

  (* A pointer is an int address in the heap. A variable is a pointer
   * to a pointer to a value. A field is also a pointer to a pointer to
   * a value. A class is a pointer to pointer to Vobject. An object too.
   *)
  | Vptr of int
  (* todo: extract Vptr out of 'value', to have clear different types.
   * | Vptr1    of ptr1
   * | Vptr2    of ptr2
   * where ptr1 and ptr2 are abstract types, with a module with a
   * set_ptr1 taking only a value, and set_ptr2 take only a Vptr
   *)
  (* pad: because of some imprecision, we actually have a set of addresses ? *)
