(* 
 * The test coverage analysis of pfff we do for facebook depends on
 * multiple components:
 * 
 *  - xdebug, and our ocaml binding to the runner and trace format
 *  - phpunit, and our ocaml binding to the runner and result format
 *  - some facebook extensions to phpunit and the way we run tests
 *  - some facebook specificities because of flib
 *  - the way we run php (zend or hphp)
 *  - MPI
 * 
 * If we want to unit tests, we need to remove from the equations a few
 * things. For instance we can get a trace without having to conform to
 * phpunit or to the test runner scripts we use by having
 * the coverage analysis function taking the specifics as 
 * parameters. So here we go into different steps:
 * 
 *  - first bypass almost everything (the conformance to phpunit, 
 *    to our test infrastructure), and instead just execute php code
 *    under xdebug with the basic php interpreter.
 *  - TODO introduce phpunit, and the fact that we bypass failing tests
 *  - TODO introduce facebook specificities
 * 
 * UPDATE: this is now obsolete. See facebook/qa_test/unit_qa_test.ml
 * which use HPHP instead of Xdebug.
