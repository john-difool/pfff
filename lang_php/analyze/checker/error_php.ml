 * is simpler to put the error location in a field and have a simple
 * error_kind (having a simple error_kind independent of location also
 * makes it easy to have "stable" errors independent of repository
 * which makes it easy to have cmf --only-new-errors working correctly).
 * 
 *)

   * and just have error().

 * (for functions/classes/constants, variables, members, files, etc)
 * 
 * coupling: if you add a constructor here, don't forget to extend
 * layer_checker_php.ml too.
 * 
 * note: try to not put structure that have position information in 
 * the type below (so use string, not Ast_php.name), so that the
 * error_kind is location independent and can be used portably as a key
 * through different repository (cf cmf --only-new-errors).
