(* Prelude  *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(*
 * Parsing OPA turns out to be quite difficult. The official grammar 
 * is not yacc compliant (opalang/ uses a PEG parser, not a LALR(1) one).
 * This module provides a view of tokens, a view where
 * tokens at least are grouped together in a tree: parenthesis
 * chunks, braced chunks, xml chunks, etc.
 * This is similar to what I do in token_views_cpp.ml.
 * 
 * This tree can then be used in highlight_opa.ml or ast_fuzzy_opa.ml to
 * at least detect and colorize appropriately functions, types, etc.
 *)
