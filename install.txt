You must first install a recent version of 
 - OCaml (at least 4.01.0), 
   see http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
 - GTK (at least gtk 2.10) and Cairo
   if you want codemap and codegraph, the fancy graphics code visualizers.
 - SWI-prolog
   if you want the interactive code query tool

If you want most of the good things just type:

  $ ./configure
  $ make depend
  $ make
  $ make opt

This should generate a few binaries at the toplevel directory such
as pfff or codemap.

If you just want to compile the parsing frontends, then type 

   $ ./configure -novisual
