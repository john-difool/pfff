(* 
 * Clang needs to know how to compile source files to know how to call
 * cpp on them. clang-check and other clang tools rely on a 
 * compile_commands.json files describing such settings.
 * See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html
 * 
 * One can generate this compile_commands.json by:
 *  - if the project uses cmake, run 'cmake CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=on'
 *  - provide a fake gcc/clang frontend script recording all compile
 *    commands and then running the actual compiler
 *  - analyzing the make compilation trace a posteriori
 *  - processing the xcodebuild trace, 
 *    http://docs.oclint.org/en/dev/usage/oclint-xcodebuild.html
 *  - intercept system calls while compiling a project, the coverity approach
 *    * https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear (just started)
 *    * https://github.com/pgbovine/CDE/
 *    * ??
 * 
 * todo: analyze the -I and use realpath on its argument => easier
 * to merge trace from subdirectories.

(* Main entry points *)
(*****************************************************************************)

(* Some 'compile_commands.json' files contain multiple times the same entry
 * for a filename, because files can be compiled with different arguments,
 * e.g. to be built as an object for a dynamic vs static library.
 * This causes then 'clang-check --ast-dump' to generate wrong .clang
 * files with multiple times a TranslationUnitDecl. So let's filter
 * those duplicate entries.
